# Project in Artificial Nerual Networks (CS-456) at EPFL
This is the repository for the project in the course Artificial Neural Networks (CS-456) at  EPFL

### Description
The goal of the project is to explore different ways an agent can learn to play the famous game Tic Tac Toe. In particular, we train an agent by letting it both play against the optimal policy and itself, and we compare the results for both tabular and deep Q-learning. The complete project description is found under `MP_TicTacToe`.

### Deliverables
The project report is found as the pdf file named `report.pdf`. All results shown in the report are produced in the notebook `tic_tac_toe.ipynb`, where the various `.py` files provide the necessary framework for computation.
